# Memory management

## Goals

Manage DRAM (physical memory) on behalf of the processes. Virtual mem size might be larger than physical mem size.
OS must be able:
- allocate (allocate, replace)
- arbitrate (address translation and validation)

Page-base memory management:
- allocate = page (virtual) -> page frames (physical)
- arbitrate = page tables

Segment-based memory management:
- allocate = segments
- arbitrate = segment registers

## H/W support:
- MMU (memory management unit). Translates virtual -> physical. Generates faults (illegal access, permissions, not found)
- registers (pointers to page tables, number of segments)
- cache - translation lookaside buffer (TLB). valid virtual -> physical translations

## Page-based management

Virtual page size == physical page size. Virtual address =  virtual page number (VPN) + offset. Physical address =  physical frame number (PFN) + offset. 
Table is created per process. CPU register (CR3 on x86) points to the current context table. Physical memory allocated on first touch. Unused pages reclaimed. Table has `valid bit` (`present bit`). 

Generic page table entry:
| PFN | ... | X | W | R | A | D | P |
P - present
D - dirty (written to)
A - accessed
XWR - permissions

x86 page table entry:
| PFN | ... | G | PAT | D | A | PCD | PWT | U/S | R/W | P |
P - present
D - dirty
A - accessed
R/W - permissions. 0 = R, 1 = R&W
U/S - permissions. 0 = usermode, 1 = supervisor
others - caching info (write thourhg, caching disabled, etc)
... - reserved for future

MMU uses flags to determine the validity of the address. For invalid entries it traps into kernel. Page fault handler takes over. Possible actions: bring page from disk, protection error, etc. On x86 faulting addr is tored in CR3 register.

### Hierarchical page tables 

Save space. On 64bit architectures flat page table needs to map to potentially lots of memory. So page table size is also large. Solution: create a page table of page tables. If needed, add additional levels of outer page tables.
Address structure:
| P1 | ... | PN | offset |

Overhead - N additional memory accesses to get the final address. Solution: translation look-aside buffer (TLB) = address translation cache. Can be per core or shared.

### Inverted page tables

Reason: physical memory much smaller than virtual memory
Virtual (logical) address: | pid | virtual page number (p) | offset (d) |
Table: array of | pid | p | physical page number (i) |
Physical address: | i | d |
Problem: Linear search for | pid | p | pair in the table
Solution: hash table
