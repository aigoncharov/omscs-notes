# Memory management

## Goals

Manage DRAM (physical memory) on behalf of the processes. Virtual mem size might be larger than physical mem size.
OS must be able:
- allocate (allocate, replace)
- arbitrate (address translation and validation)

Page-base memory management:
- allocate = page (virtual) -> page frames (physical)
- arbitrate = page tables

Segment-based memory management:
- allocate = segments
- arbitrate = segment registers

H/W support:
- MMU (memory management unit). Translates virtual -> physical. Generates faults (illegal access, permissions, not found)
- registers (pointers to page tables, number of segments)
- cache - translation lookaside buffer (TLB). valid virtual -> physical translations
