# Virtualization

Allows concurrent execution of multiple OSes on the same machine.
Management of physical hardware = VM monitor (VMM) or hypervisor.

Goals:
1. identical env
2. minor performance degradation
3. vmm in complete control os system resources (isolation)

Pros:
- consolidation
- migration
- security
- debugging
- support for legacy OS

Models:
1. Bare-metal (hypervisor) - type 1 
  1. Uses privileged service VM to deal with devices (Xen - Citrix)
  2. Drivers in VMM, open APIs (ESX - VMware)
2. Hosted - type 2 (KVM = KVM kernel + QEMU for hardware virtualization)

Guest instructions executed directly by hardware

Approaches:
1. Binary translation (guest os not modified, dynamic binary translation)
2. Paravirtualization (guest OS modified, explicit calls to hypervisor)

Memory virtualization:
1. Full virtualization (contiguous physical memory starting at 0)
  1. Virtual address -> Physical address -> Machine address
  2. Shadow PT for speed: VA -> PA mapped to VA -> MA. Invalidate on ctx switch.
1. Paravitualized
  1. No requirement for contiguous physical memory starting at 0
  2. Explicitly registers page tables with hypervisor

Device virtualization:
1. Passthrough. VMM-level driver configures permissions and allows direct access to the device
  1. Device sharing is difficult
  2. VM migration is difficult because of the device state
  3. VMM must hast have exact device that VM expects
2. Hypervisor-direct
  1. Hypervisor intercepts all device accesses
  2. Emulate device
  3. VM decoupled
  4. Latency
  5. Hypervisor must support device driver emulation
3. Split-device driver
  1. Front-end driver on VM
  2. Backend driver on service VM or host
  3. Easier device sharing
