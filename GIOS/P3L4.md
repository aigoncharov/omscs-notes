# Synchronization

## Spinlock

If a lock is busy, a thread spins.

Performance metrics:
- reduce latency
- reduce waiting time
- reduce contention

Delay spinlock:
- contention ok
- latency ok
- delay bad

Delay:
- static (like CPU ID or etc)
- dynamic (backoff-based)

### Queuing lock
flags array (0..N-1), where N - CPU num. Increment queuelast for each `lock` Depends on read_and_increment.

- latency bad
- delay ok
- contention ok (requires cache coherence and cacheline aligned elements)


## Semaphore

- init - assign a max int
- on try - if non-zero - decrement and proceed
- on exit - increment

## Reader-writer locks

rwlock_r, read_lock/unlock (shared), write_lock/unlock (exclusive).

## Monitors

High-level sync construct
Specify: 
- shared resource
- entry/exit proc
- possible cond vars

## Atomic instructions

- test_and_set
- read_and_increment
- compare_and_swap

Bypass caches. Generate cache coherence traffic (invalidate caches).
