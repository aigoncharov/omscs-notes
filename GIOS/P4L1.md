# rpc

- higher level interface for data movement and communication
- error handling
- hide complexity of cross-machine interactions

requirements:
1. client/server
2. sync
3. type checking
4. cross-machine conversion
5. higher-level protocol

steps:
0. server registers
0. bind - find and bind to the server
1. call - make rpc call, block
2. marshall - serialize ars into a buffer
3. send
4. receive
5. unmarshall - deserialize
6. actual proc call
7. reverse direction for the result

automate sub generation = interface definition language IDL
- procedure name, args, 2 result types
- version

Can be:
- language agnostic
- language specific

Pointers:
1. No pointers
2. Serialize pointer (copy data from reference)

Sun RPC

1. machine known upfront. per-machine registry daemon (portmapper)
2. IDL = XDR (language agnostic)
3. pointers allowed and serialized
4. failures - retires, return as much as possible

rpcgen compiles xdr file to language-specific stubs

xdr = idl + encoding

encoding rules:
- data types encoded in multiples of 4 bytes
- big endian
