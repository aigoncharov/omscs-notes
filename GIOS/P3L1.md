# Scheduling

## Scheduling options

- Assign tasks immediately
    - Simple (FCFS - First come first serve)
- Assign simple tasks first
    - Maximized throughput (SJF - Simple job first)
- Assign complex tasks first
    - Maximize resource utilization

## Scheduling overview

Scheduler chooses one task from the `ready queue` (implemented via `runqueue` data structure) and runs it on CPU.
Task can get into the ready queue after:
- IO req
- It was interrupted in favor of another task (time slice expired)
- It is a newly created task (fork)
- It was interrupted because of an interrupt

Scheduler dispatched threads on CPU:
- Context switch
- Enter user mode
- Set PC
- Go!

Scheduler policy/algorithm defines what task is going to be selected.
Scheduling algo and runqueue limit each other.

## Run-to-completion (no preemption)

FCFS:
- runqueue - FIFO queue

SJF:
- runqueue - ordered queue or tree
- throughput is the same, avg completions time and average wait time is better

## Preemptive scheduling

### SJF

We don't really know exec time. Use heuristics based on history:
- how long did a task run last time?
- how long did a task run last n times? (windowed average)

### Priority based

runqueue:
- Several queues for each priority level
- Or tree ordered by the priority

Risk - starvation (higher priority queue never gets empty). Solution - priority aging. priority = f(initial priority, time spent in the queue), gets higher with time.

Priority inversion - situation when a higher priority task tries to lock on a mutex that a lower priority task have locked before. Solution - boost a priority of the required mutex owner.

### Round Robin

FCFS, but tasks may yield (e.g. for I/O). Round Robin + interleaving = preempt any task after curtain amount of time (time slice).

Timeslice - maximum amount of time uninterrupted time given to a task (`time quantum`).
Pros:
- short tasks finish sooner
- more responsive
- lengthy io ops initiated sooner
Cons:
- overheads (interrupt, context switch, schedule)

CPU-bound tasks - larger time slices. IO-bound tasks - smaller time slices.
