# Inter-process communication

Processes can:
- share memory
- exchange messages
- synchronize

IPC:
- message-based (sockets, pipes, message queues)
- memory-based (shared memory, memory mapped files)
- RPC (remote procedure call)
- sync primitives

## Message-passing

OS creates and maintains a channel. OS provides an interface (`port`) for processes. 
send - syscall + data copy
recv - syscall + data copy

Forms:
- pipe (byte stream)
- message queue (e.g. sockets)

## Shared memory IPC

OS maps virtual pages of processes to the same physical page.

Shared memory (`map`) makes sense to use over message-based IPC (`copy`) if:
- used many times
- large single data transfers

## SysV

Physical pages not contiguous. System limits on number of segments and total size. 

1. Create (OS assigns a unique key) - `shmget` (create) and `ftok` (get key)
    1. Key must be communicated to other processes via different IPC methods
2. Attach (map virtual -> physical) - `shmat`
3. Detach (invalidate virtual) - `shmdt`
4. Destroy (explicit call only) - `smhctl`

## POSIX shared memory API

Files (in `tmpfs`) instead of segments. 

1. Create - `shm_open`
2. Attach - `mmap` and `unmmap`
3. Detach - `shm_close`
4. Destroy -  `shm_unlink`

### pthreads

Use PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED. Sync data structures must be in shared memory region.

### message queue

Send messages about current state (ready, ok, etc)

### semaphores

binary semaphore = mutex
