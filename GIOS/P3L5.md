# I/O Management

- Protocols
- Dedicated handlers
- Decouple io from core processing

## Basic io device features

- Control registers
  - command
  - data transfers
  - status
- Microcontroller (CPU)
- On-device memory
- Other hw specific chips

Use buses to communicate (PCI, SCSI, serial, parallel)

## Memory-mapped io

access device == memory load/store

- part of of host physical memory is dedicated for device interactions
- base address registers (BAR)

## device -> cpu

1. interrupt. pros: generated asap. cons: interrupt handling steps.
2. polling. pros: convenient for os. cons: delay, cpu overhead.

## Programmed io (pio)

write commands and data to device registers

## direct memory access (dma)

write commands to the command register, configure dma controller, dma controller does the data transfer

## bypass

user process -> (no kernel) driver -> device 

## block devices

Stack:
user process -> kernel -> generic block layer -> driver -> device

Virtual file system (vfs):
user process -> kernel (vfs ->  actual fs) -> generic block layer -> driver -> device

VFS abstractions:
- file
- file descriptor
- inode (list of file data blocks, device, permissions, size)
- dentry (directory entry)
- superblock

## ext2

| boot | block group 1 | block group 2 | ...

block group 1:
| super block | group desc | block bitmap | inode bitmap | inodes | data blocks |

To represent large files we can use indirect pointer for inodes = pointer in inode points to a block of address pointers
