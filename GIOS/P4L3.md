# Distributed shared memory (DSM)

Pros:
- more shared memory

Cons:
- Slower access

Options:
1. H/W supported
  1. Interconnect
  2. NICs translate remote mem accesses to messages
  3. Expensive
2. S/W supported

Granularity:
1. Pages (OS-level)
2. Objects (app level)

False sharing - X and Y are on the same mem page. P1 modifies only X, P2 modifies only Y. DSM starts conflict resolution because of the concurrent access to the same mem page.

Access algorithms:
- single reader/single writer
- multiple readers/single writer
- multiple readers/multiple writers

Migration - move data for access. Makes sense SRSW.
Replication (caching). Requires consistency mgmt.

Page-based DSM:
- every nodes con tributes part of mem pages to DSM
- need local caches for performance
- all nodes reponsible for part of distributed mem
- home node manages access and tracks page ownership
- explicit replication possible for load balancing, perf, reliability

Pages hes:
- address = nodeid + page frame number
Replicated global map, partitioned metadata for local ages.

Use OS invalid mem access traps to add DSM support.

## Consistency model

Agreement between memory state and upper sw levels.

1. Strict. Updates visible everywhere immediately.
2. Sequential. Updates may be arbitrarily interleaved. All processes see the same interleaving. Operations from the same processalways apper in order the were issued.
3. Causal. Causally-related writes ordered. For other writes - no guarantees.
4. Weak. Sync point == all prior updates visible. Limit data movement. Maintain extra state.
