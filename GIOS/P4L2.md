# distributed file systems

file-system interface -> VFS -> underlying actual file systems

extreme remote file service options:
1. upload/download
2. true remote

compromise:
1. store blocks (parts of the file)
2. force clients to interact with server frequently

stateless:
- no caching and consistency mgmt
- network overhead
- no resourses are used for the state
- resilient (restart on failure)

stateful:
- support locking, caching, incremental operations
- checkpointing on failure
- overheads to maintain state

## caching state if dfs

locally clients maintain a part of the state. requires coherence mechanisms.

## file-sharing semantics

unix = every write is immediately visible
session = write back on close, update on open
periodic updates = write-back periodically, server invalidates periodically
immutable files = never modify, new files created
transactions = all changes atomic

## replication

- load balancing
- availability
- fault tolerance
- writes more complex

## partitioning

- scalability
- availability (vs single server)
- single file writes simpler
- on failure lose portion of data
- load balancing is harder

## NFS

client -> vfs -> nfs client -> rpc client stub -> network -> rpc server stub -> nfs server -> vfs

nvf3 - stateless, nfs4 - stateful

caching:
- session-based
- periodic updates
- nfs4 - delegation to client for a period of time

locking:
- lease-based
- nfs4 - share reservation (read-write lock)

## sprite dfs

research dfs.

stats:
- 33% of all file accesses are writes.
- 75% of files are opened less than 0.5 sec
- 90% of files are opened less than 10 sec
- 20-30% of new data deleted within 30sec
- 50% of new data deleted deleted withing 5 minutes
- file sharing is very rare

conslusions:
- caching ok, write-through not sufficient
- session if too much overhead
- write-back on close not necessary
- no need to optimize concurrent access, but must support it

design:
- cache with write-back. every 30 secs write-back blocks than have not been modified the last 30sec. when client opens dirty file, get dirty blocks.
- open gores top the server. directories are not cached
- on concurrent write disable caching

data structures:
- client
  - cache (state)
  - cached blocks
  - timer for each dirty block
  - version
- server
  - readers
  - writer
  - version
  - cacheable
