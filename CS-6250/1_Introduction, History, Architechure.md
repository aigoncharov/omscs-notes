ARPANET -> NCP -> TCP/IP -> DNS and WWW

## Layered arch

Pros:
- flexibility
- modularity
- scalability

Layers:
- Application
    - Application
    - Presentation
    - Session
- Transport
- Network
- Datalink
- Physical

e2e principle is summarized as: the network core should be simple and minimal, while the end systems should carry the intelligence.

Why IPv4 rose?
- not trying to compete with the telephone network services
- the stability of the two transport protocols adds to the stability of IPv4

even if these brand new architectures do not have the shape of an hourglass initially, they will probably do so as they evolve, which will lead to new ossified protocols
